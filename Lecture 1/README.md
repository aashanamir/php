# PHP Basics

### 1. PHP Introduction:
PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used open-source scripting language designed for web development. Originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive websites.

### 2. How PHP Works?
PHP works as a server-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the web server rather than the user's browser. When a user requests a PHP file from a server, the server processes the PHP code and sends the resulting HTML back to the user's browser. This allows for dynamic content generation, database interaction, and other server-side tasks.

### 3. Environment Setup:
Setting up a PHP development environment is relatively straightforward. You'll need a web server (such as Apache or Nginx) with PHP installed, along with a database server (such as MySQL) if your application requires database access. Alternatively, you can use pre-packaged solutions like XAMPP or WAMP, which include all the necessary components for PHP development in a single package.

### 4. PHP - Hello World Program:
Let's start with a simple "Hello World" program in PHP to get you acquainted with the syntax and structure of PHP code:

```php
<?php
// PHP code starts with "<?php" and ends with "?>"

// This is a comment in PHP

// Use the echo statement to output text

echo "Hello, world!";

// PHP code can be embedded within HTML
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PHP Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php echo "Hello, world!"; ?></h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we use the echo statement to output "Hello, world!" to the browser. We also embed PHP code within HTML to achieve the same output.

### 5. PHP - Syntax:

PHP syntax is similar to C, Java, and Perl, making it relatively easy to learn for programmers familiar with those languages. Some key points about PHP syntax include:


PHP code is enclosed within <?php ... ?> tags.
Statements end with a semicolon (;).
Variables in PHP start with the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name.
PHP is not case-sensitive, but variable names are case-sensitive.
Comments can be single-line (//) or multi-line (/* ... */).

These are the foundational topics we'll explore in this chapter to kickstart your journey into PHP development. Let's dive deeper into each topic to gain a comprehensive understanding of PHP programming.
